Deblur Qiita Plugin
===================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

Qiita (canonically pronounced *cheetah*) is an analysis environment for microbiome (and other "comparative -omics") datasets.

This package includes the deblur functionality for Qiita.

`Deblur <https://github.com/biocore/deblur>`__ is a greedy deconvolution algorithm based on Illumina Miseq/Hiseq error profiles.

Note that deblur has vsearch, mafft, SortMeRNA==2.0 and fragment-insertion as requirements but these are not installed as part of the install.
